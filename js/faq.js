        q: "FAQs About Inter IIT Tech Meet",
        a: "<p><b>a) What is Inter IIT Tech Meet?</b><br/>An Inter IIT Tech Meet is an annual event in which all the IITs compete with each other to tackle technical problems. It consists of High, Mid, and Low prep events with a decreasing order of point weightage. The final presentation round happens for 2 days around March, but the preparations start nearly 2 months before!</p><p><b>b) How can I contribute? Any prerequisites?</b><br/>The events are open to all and there aren’t any “prerequisites” as such, but it helps to have them in some events. What is most valuable is your contribution to the team, and you can do that according to your own capacity and skill. The teams will be decided based on the contributions one makes in the first couple of days.</p><p><b>c) What are the high/mid/low preparation events?</b><br/>High/mid prep events are team events (6-10 people) in which you propose a solution to a problem statement and are usually composed of a report/prototype followed by a final presentation in front of the judges. These carry by far the most weight (400 points for high prep, 250 points for mid prep). Low preparation events are team events (mostly) and are relatively easier compared to mid and high-prep events. They are released 1-2 weeks prior to the presentation round. </p><p><b>d) Why should I participate?</b><br/>Why shouldn’t you? It is a wonderful way to network and work with like-minded people and create something of your own (not to mention you can show off certificates/projects in your CV)! Participation is important more than anything. It provides a platform to test yourself and feeds you with new ideas from other top IITs. These events make a huge contribution to the technical culture of IITs, and you should try your best to make use of this privilege!</p>"
